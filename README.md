Hermès Projet

The Hermès projet is built for the following obvious reasons which rarely encounter ordinary people:
1, there are Hermès bags that some people are willing to pay more ( enough to pay a programmer for writing this code );
2, these bags, once for a while (or a year), showed up in the Hermès website, available right away for everyone, instead of reservation, waiting, buying no good product to please the sale lady.


So, here is what the code does:
1, if one of the bags in the wish list show up one the website, an alert email will be sent to your email adresse, with the name, eventually the photo of the bag precisely.
 

Voilà.
